### ANSG (Applied Nuclear Science Group)
<!---->
- **73mGe** — Precision gamma-ray measurements of 73mGe using a state-of-the-art position sensitive CZT detector.
- **78mBr** — Half-life measurement of 78mBr by self-coincidence analysis in a LaBr3 detector.
- **YAP-PSD** — Machine learning-based pulse shape discrimination in YAP:Ce, comparing Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and MLP models.
<!---->
### MUSIC (Multi-Sampling Ionization Chamber at Argonne National Lab)
<!---->
- **ProductionMode_37Cl** — Event building and timing analysis for the MUSIC detector array, including binary data conversion, multi-board timing synchronization, and event reconstruction.
- **SiCalibration_37Cl** — Silicon diode energy loss measurement used for validating the stopping power tables for 37Cl in helium gas.

## Dependencies
<!---->
All projects depend on [Analysis-Utilities](https://github.com/ewtodd/Analysis-Utilities), a shared library providing common ROOT-based analysis tools.

## Reproducibility
<!---->
This project uses [Nix](https://nixos.org/) to manage dependencies.
Install it by following the instructions [here](https://nixos.org/download/).
Ensure [flakes are enabled](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Enable_flakes_permanently) in your Nix configuration.
All directories contain their own Nix flake, which can be used to re-run code with the exact same environment as I did.
