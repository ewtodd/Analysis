This project uses [Nix](https://nixos.org/) to manage dependencies.
Install it by following the instructions [here](https://nixos.org/download/).
Ensure [flakes are enabled](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Enable_flakes_permanently) in your Nix configuration.
All directories contain their own nix flake, which can be used to re-run code with the exact same environment as I did. Contact me for access to data.
